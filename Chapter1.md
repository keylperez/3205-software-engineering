# Software Engineering

- All developed nation's eceonomy are dependent on software
- More & more systems are software controlled
- Software Engineering is concerned with theories, methods andtools for professional software development
- Expenditure (fund spending) on software represents a significant fraction of GNP(Gross National Product) in all developed countries

### Sofware Costs

- Often dominate computer system cost | software cost > hardware cost
- maintain cost > develop cost
- conconcerned w/ cost-effective software devlopment

### Software products

- Generic products
  - Marketed & stold stand-alone systems
- Customized products - Commisionoed software by customer to meet their needs

### Product Specification

- Generic product
  - Software Developer owns specifications of software
  - decisions on changes are made by developer

### Essential Attributes of good software

1. Maintainability - written in a way it can evolve to meet the changing needs of customers
2. Dependability & Security - includes characteristics:
   - Reliability
   - Security
   - Safety

- Should not cause physical or economic damage
- Malicious users should not be able to access

3. Effeciency - not make wasteful use of system resources such as memory \* processor cycles. Includes resopnsiveness, processing time, memory utilization, etc.
4. Accessibility - Software must be acceptable to the type of users for which it is designed. Understandable; usable & compatible w/other systems
