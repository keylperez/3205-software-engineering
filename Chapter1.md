# Software Engineering

- All developed nation's eceonomy are dependent on software
- More & more systems are software controlled
- Software Engineering is concerned with theories, methods andtools for professional software development
- Expenditure (fund spending) on software represents a significant fraction of GNP(Gross National Product) in all developed countries

### Sofware Costs

- Often dominate computer system cost | software cost > hardware cost
- maintain cost > develop cost
- conconcerned w/ cost-effective software devlopment

### Software products

- Generic products
  - Marketed & stold stand-alone systems
- Customized products - Commisionoed software by customer to meet their needs

### Product Specification

- Generic product
  - Software Developer owns specifications of software
  - decisions on changes are made by developer

### Essential Attributes of good software

1. Maintainability - written in a way it can evolve to meet the changing needs of customers
2. Dependability & Security - includes characteristics:
   - Reliability
   - Security
   - Safety

- Should not cause physical or economic damage
- Malicious users should not be able to access

3. Effeciency - not make wasteful use of system resources such as memory \* processor cycles. Includes resopnsiveness, processing time, memory utilization, etc.
4. Accessibility - Software must be acceptable to the type of users for which it is designed. Understandable; usable & compatible w/other systems

### Software Engineering

- Engineering discipline concernred w/all aspects of software production from early stages of system
  0 Engineering Discipline - using appropriate theories & methods to solve problems w/ organizational & financial constraints
- All aspects of software production
  - project management & development of tools, methods to support software production
    ###Importance of Software Engineering
- produce reliable & trustworthy systems econmically & quickly
- cheaper in the long run

### Software process activities

- Software Specification 0 customers Y engineers define software
- Software Developoment - where the software is designed & programmed
- Software Validation - software is checked to ensure customer requirements are met
- Software Evolution - software modified to reflect changing customer & market requirements

###General Issues that affect softwares

1. Heterogeneity - different platforms
2. Business & Social Change - catch up to latest technology
3. Security & Trust

### Software Engineering Diversity

- different tyeps of software system
- methods & tool s depend on types of application

### Application Types

- Stand-alone applications
  - App Systems that run on a local computers. Includes necessary functionality and don't need to be connected to the network.
- Interactive transaction-based applications
  - Apps that execute on a remote computer and are accessed by users from their own PCs or terminals.
- Embedded control system
  - control & manage hardware devices.

### Application Types

- Batch processing systems
  - designed to process data in large batches. Process large numbers of inputs to create corresponding outputs
- Entertainment systems
  - primarily for personal use and intended to entertain user
- Systems for modeling & simulatinon
  - developed by scientist and engineers to model physical processes or situations
- Data collection systems
  - system that collect data from their environement using a set of sensors and send data to other systems for processing
- Systems of systems
  - composed of a number of other software systems

### Software engineering fundamentals

- Fundamental principles for all software systems
  - should be developed using a managed and understood development process.
- Dependability and performance
- Understanding and managing the software specification & requirements
- reuse software that has already been developed rather than write new software

### Software engineering and the web

- The WEb is now a platform for running application and
  organizations are increasingly developing web-based systems rather than local systems
